## 🎯 Problem Statement

_Standard weather apps are passive; they show high AQI numbers but offer no guidance on how to navigate them safely._

- **Context:** Users see "AQI 200" but don't know if they should run, commute, or stay indoors.
- **Impact:** Commuters, athletes, and sensitive groups unknowingly expose themselves to toxic hotspots.
- **Gap:** Official sensors are sparse, often missing hyper-local hazards like garbage fires or construction dust.

## 💡 Solution

_AeroGuard replaces passive dashboards with an Agentic AI that thinks, plans, sees, and protects._

1.  **Agentic Intelligence:** A Gemini-powered agent that autonomously fetches live data to answer queries like "Is it safe to run?" with specific advice.
2.  **Green Routing:** An innovative navigation engine that calculates and suggests "Cleaner Air Routes" alongside the standard fastest path.
3.  **Citizen Sentinel:** A community-driven layer where users report hazards (e.g., smoke), verified instantly by Gemini Vision to update the map for everyone.
4.  **Visual Perception:** A real-time pollution heatmap overlay that makes invisible toxins visible on the map for better awareness.

5.  **Gamification:** Inmplented a points system for every clean route and correctly marked hazard to user.
