## 🎯 Problem Statement

_Standard weather apps are passive; they show high AQI numbers but offer no guidance on how to navigate them safely._

- **Context:** Users see "AQI 200" but don't know if they should run, commute, or stay indoors.
- **Impact:** Commuters, athletes, and sensitive groups unknowingly expose themselves to toxic hotspots.

## 💡 Solution

_AeroGuard replaces passive dashboards with an Agentic AI that thinks, plans, and protects._

1.  **Agentic Intelligence:** A Gemini-powered agent that autonomously fetches live data to answer queries like "Is it safe to run?" with specific advice.
2.  **Green Routing:** An innovative navigation engine that calculates and suggests "Cleaner Air Routes" alongside the standard fastest path.
3.  **Visual Perception:** A real-time pollution heatmap overlay that makes invisible toxins visible on the map for better awareness.
